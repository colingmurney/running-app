Migrate Strava and NIke+ Run Club data

# TO-DO

Figure out how to get more than 30 activities from Nike and Strava

Refactor to remove StravaTemplate and just make a new object each iteration in formatNike.js

Error and success messages on screen

Make download to CSV function and button (make form that gives choice JSON or CSV. Maybe option to get complete data instead of formatted for Nike(would to make new request for this))

Create Select All button for all data pages

Expand and clean table and Nike API result from backend

App crashes if I click all over table too quickly

Display message when Nike Token isn't valid

Client (JOI) authentication

Change the format of that the weather appears in description for Nike imports in formatNike.js (Ex: partly_sunny -> Partly sunny)
